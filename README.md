# Lab Program - Highway Code

## Overview

This repository contains the codes , personally worked on  for my lab program in the course "Masters Degree in java Object-Oriented Application Development" (Course Code: IT 511) in Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. 
## Lab Program Description

The lab program is designed to showcase my proficiency in Java programming and problem-solving skills. This program calculates the fewest number of coins required to represent a given amount of change in pennies. The coin types used are Dollars, Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies. The program takes the total change amount as an integer input and outputs the minimum number of coins needed, with each coin type listed on a separate line.
