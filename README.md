# Lab Program - Highway Code

## Overview

This repository contains the codes , personally worked on  for my lab program in the course "Masters Degree in Object-Oriented Application Development" (Course Code: IT 511) in Southern New Hampshire Univeristy. This lab program focuses on analyzing the highway code and implementing a Java program to determine the classification and direction of a given highway number.

## Lab Program Description

The lab program is designed to showcase my proficiency in Java programming and problem-solving skills. It involves writing a Java program that analyzes the given highway number and provides information about whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. Additionally, the program determines the direction of the highway based on the provided specifications of the U.S. interstate highway system.
