# Login Name Generator

This program generates a login name for a user based on their first name, last name, and a four-digit integer input. The login name is constructed by taking the first six letters of the first name (or all letters if the first name has less than six letters), followed by the first letter of the last name, an underscore (_), and then the last digit of the input number obtained using the % operator.

## Description

Creating a login name for users is a common requirement in many systems. This program automates the process by taking the user's first name, last name, and a four-digit integer as input. It then generates a login name according to the specified format. This standardized login name format allows for easy identification and authentication of users in various applications.

## Usage

To use the program, provide the user's first name, last name, and a four-digit integer as input. The program will then generate the login name based on the provided information and display the result.
